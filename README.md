## Files and their use:
  - anomaly_distance.py:
    - Used to find anomaly based on distance. Checks for certain features the furthest combination in feature space.
  - anomaly_gen_distance.py:
    - Generates the dataset for values of feature found in anomaly_distance.py
  - anomaly_joint_prob.py
    - Works the same way as anomaly_distance.py. The only difference is that it gets the probability instead of distance.
    - anomaly_gen_distance.py should be used to generate the dataset with certain feature value.
  - anomaly_training.py
    - For training third party anomaly detector models from Pyod including Iforest, Knn, Autoencoders.
  - autoencoder.py:
    - Pytorch's Model implementation of autoencoder
  - autoencoder_run.py:
    - script for training the above autoencoder.
  - autoencoder_validate.py:
    - Works as a test run for above autoencoder trained. You supply a normal and anomalous dataset, and plot a scatter-plot for both. Anomalous points are expected to have higher loss value.
  - census_data_prep.py:
    - To prepare and clean the census dataset.
  - check_dependance.py:
    - Generates a correlation matrix for continous features, to get an idea about generating anomalies. (Not uses)
  - plot_anomalies.py:
    - To generate a scatter-plot with mutliple types of already generated anomalies.
  - plot_from_txt.py:
    - Used to generate explanation (bar) plots using shapley score's json. Not used anymore as implemented in shapley_optmised.py itself.
